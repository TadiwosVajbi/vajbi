# Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration errors with the message:
```
Uncaught Error: Hydration failed because the server rendered text didn't match the client.
```

## Root Causes
1. **usePathname() hook in Header component**: The `usePathname()` hook returns different values on server vs client
2. **Client components in server layouts**: Client components with hooks being used in server component layouts
3. **Dynamic path generation**: Language switcher links depending on client-side pathname
4. **Search params in client components**: `useSearchParams()` causing mismatches

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Mounted State Pattern in Header Component
Updated `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to:
- Use mounted state to prevent usePathname() hydration issues
- Render static language switcher during SSR
- Only show interactive links after client-side mounting
- Use suppressHydrationWarning for language switcher container

### 2. Client Component Hydration Handling
Added mounted state checks in components using client-side hooks:
- `Header.tsx`: Prevents usePathname() hydration issues
- `JobApplicationForm.tsx`: Handles useSearchParams() properly
- `AboutPage.tsx`: Manages client-side state initialization

### 3. NoSSR Component
Created `src/components/NoSSR.tsx` for reusable hydration prevention:
- Can be used to wrap any component with hydration issues
- Provides fallback content during SSR
- Ensures client-only rendering when needed

### 4. suppressHydrationWarning
Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to:
- Layout body element
- Footer copyright section
- Language switcher container in Header

## Files Modified
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Added mounted state and hydration handling
- `src/app/[lang]/layout.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to body
- `src/app/[lang]/about/page.tsx` - Added mounted state
- `src/app/[lang]/careers/apply/JobApplicationForm.tsx` - Added hydration handling
- `src/components/NoSSR.tsx` - New utility component

## Best Practices for Future Development
1. Always use mounted state for components with client-side hooks
2. Consider using NoSSR component for browser-only features
3. Add suppressHydrationWarning sparingly and only when necessary
4. Test hydration by checking browser console for errors
5. Prefer server components when possible, use client components only when needed

## Testing
- No hydration errors in browser console
- Language switching works correctly
- All pages load without SSR/client mismatches
- Navigation functions properly across all routes
